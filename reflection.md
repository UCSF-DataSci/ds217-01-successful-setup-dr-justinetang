# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
[Tell us a bit about yourself - your field of study, professional background, interests, or anything else you'd like to share]
Hi, I'm Justine. I'm currently a T32 postdoctoral research fellow in Anesthesiology and will be applying for residency in the same specialty next year. I love learning and exploring research topics. Outside of work, I like hiking, dancing, exploring SF, and hanging out with friends.
## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
[What do you hope to gain? Specific skills, knowledge, applications, career goals?]
I'm taking this Python class to gain a solid foundation in programming. I hope to learn how to write efficient code and understand key concepts. I'm especially interested in applying Python to real-world projects, such as data analysis, since I'm currently working in clinical research. Ultimately, I want to use this knowledge to support my career goals in Anesthesiology, and who knows, maybe I'll transition to tech if I love what I'm learning, where coding is a valuable and widely-used tool.
## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
[What excites you about programming/data science? What concerns or uncertainties do you have?]
I'm most looking forward to learning how to use Python to solve real-world problems and to build things. Since AI is such a big thing at the moment, the idea of exploring how programming connects to fields like data science, especially the ability to find insights in large datasets excites me. My biggest concern is the steep learning curve, such as understanding complex concepts, but I'm willing to tackle and put in the effort to learn and ask questions when needed.
## 4. Share something you enjoy!
[Drop a link to something you really enjoy - could be a website, article, video, project, hobby, book, podcast, or anything else you're into]
